# AlphaLite
Full featured single node RotoHazard timer

yeah its a full RH timer, just smaller. Its all set up with a high quality 64gb sd card for you. Just plug in usb c(you can also wire a different connector underneath for 5v if you want. I have an mr30 to get power in and led out for the start gate). It should start a hotspot "Alpha1 Race Timer". You can connect to that with "password" for the password. RH should start automatically @ http://192.168.50.5:5000/ . You can ssh in to that ip and set up your home wifi in raspi-config and it will try to connect to that before it starts its hotspot. Rotorhazard should be admin/password for its credentials.

You have a "on the gate" mount, and a freestanding mount. Both work nice in tpu
